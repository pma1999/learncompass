npm install
# or if you use yarn
yarn install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit your `.env` file with the following required API keys:

```
# Required API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PPLX_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here

# Optional Settings

## üéÆ Usage

### Starting the Application

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
# From the root directory
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm start
# or with yarn
yarn start
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Creating a Learning Path

1. Navigate to the Generator page
2. Enter your desired learning topic
3. Adjust advanced settings if needed (optional)

3. **Access the application at:** `http://localhost:3000`

### Cloud Deployment

Deploy to Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend) for production:

1. **Backend (Railway)**
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Create a new project in Railway linking to your repository
   - Set required environment variables (API keys)
   
2. **Frontend (Vercel)**
   - Update the API URL in frontend/vercel.json with your Railway URL
   - Create a new project in Vercel linking to your repository
   - Set the root directory to "frontend"
   - Deploy the application

For a complete step-by-step guide, please refer to the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## üì° API Documentation

The backend exposes a RESTful API with the following main endpoints:

### API Key Management

- `POST /api/auth/api-keys`: Validate and store API keys securely
  - Body: `{ "google_api_key": "string", "pplx_api_key": "string" }`
  - Returns: `{ "google_key_token": "string", "pplx_key_token": "string", "google_key_valid": bool, "pplx_key_valid": bool, "google_key_error": "string", "pplx_key_error": "string" }`
  - Notes: Performs strict validation on key format and functionality. Google keys must start with "AIza" followed by 35 characters. Perplexity keys must start with "pplx-" followed by at least 32 characters. Keys are encrypted and referenced by secure tokens.

- `POST /api/validate-api-keys`: Validate API keys without storing them
  - Body: `{ "google_api_key": "string", "pplx_api_key": "string" }`
  - Returns: `{ "google_key_valid": bool, "pplx_key_valid": bool, "google_key_error": "string", "pplx_key_error": "string" }`

### Learning Path Generation

- `POST /api/generate-learning-path`: Start generating a new learning path
  - Body: `{ "topic": "string", "parallel_count": int, "search_parallel_count": int, "submodule_parallel_count": int, "google_key_token": "string", "pplx_key_token": "string" }`
  - Returns: `{ "task_id": "string", "status": "string" }`

- `GET /api/learning-path/{task_id}`: Get generation status and results
- `GET /api/progress/{task_id}`: Stream progress updates (SSE)
- `DELETE /api/learning-path/{task_id}`: Clean up completed tasks

### History Management

- `GET /api/history`: Get list of saved learning paths
- `GET /api/history/{entry_id}`: Get a specific learning path
- `POST /api/history`: Save a learning path to history
- `PUT /api/history/{entry_id}`: Update tags and favorite status
- `DELETE /api/history/{entry_id}`: Delete a learning path
- `POST /api/history/import`: Import a learning path from JSON
- `GET /api/history/export`: Export all history entries
- `DELETE /api/history/clear`: Clear all history

## üíª Development

### Debugging

Learny includes helpful debugging tools:

```bash
# Run with debug options
python debug_learning_path.py "Your Topic" --log-level DEBUG --save-result

# Analyze logs
python diagnostic.py learning_path.log --summary
```

### Key Components

- **Graph Builder**: The system uses a directed graph workflow for generating learning paths (`core/graph_builder.py`)
- **Prompt Templates**: Carefully crafted prompts for the LLM are stored in `prompts/learning_path_prompts.py`
- **State Management**: The application state flows through the graph nodes (`models/models.py`)

## Recent Code Refactoring

The codebase has been refactored to organize files into a proper Python package structure. The main changes are:

1. All backend code has been moved into a `backend` directory package
2. All imports have been updated to use the new package structure (e.g., `from backend.models.models import ...`)
3. A `setup.py` file has been added to make the package installable

### Running the Application after Refactoring

To run the application after the refactoring:

1. Install the package in development mode:
```
pip install -e .
```

2. Run the server using the new script:
```
python run_server.py
```

Alternatively, you can run it with direct module imports:
```
python -m backend.api
```

## Deployment on Railway

The application is configured for deployment on Railway. With the recent code refactoring that moved all backend code into a `/backend` directory, deployment configuration has been updated accordingly:

- `Procfile` has been updated to run from the backend directory
- `railway.json` has been configured to install dependencies from the backend directory
- `requirements.txt` in the root points to the backend requirements file
- `PYTHONPATH` is set to include the root directory so imports work correctly

These changes ensure that the application will deploy correctly on Railway despite the new directory structure.

When deploying:
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Railway's dashboard
2. The deployment will automatically use the root-level configuration files
3. No additional steps are needed - Railway will handle the new directory structure
